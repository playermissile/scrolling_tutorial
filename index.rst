A Crash Course on Fine Scrolling
=================================================================

.. centered:: **Atari 8-bit Fine Scrolling: A Tutorial**

**Revision 0, updated 5 Dec 2019**

This is a tutorial on fine scrolling for the Atari 8-bit series of computers.
In a nutshell, the ANTIC coprocessor provides 2D hardware scrolling at very
little computational expense.

This is advanced programming tutorial in the sense that the examples will be
written in assembly language, so the assumption will be that you are
comfortable with that. All the examples here are assembled using the
MAC/65-compatible assembler `ATasm
<https://atari.miribilist.com/atasm/index.html>`_ (and more specifically to
this tutorial, the version built-in to `Omnivore
<https://github.com/robmcmullen/omnivore>`_).

.. note:: All source code and XEX files are available in the `scrolling_tutorial source code repository <https://github.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial>`_ on github.



A (Small) Crash Course on Display Lists
--------------------------------------------

Display lists are an important topic for scrolling, because certain flags on
display list commands tell ANTIC which lines get scrolled and which are left
alone. For a summary, check out my :ref:`tutorial on DLIs <dli_tutorial>` which
has a large section on display list instructions.

A small amount of relevant detail is repeated here, though:

Display List Instruction Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An ANTIC display list instruction consists of 1 byte with an optional 2 byte
address. There are 3 types of instructions: blank lines, graphics modes, and
jump instructions. Instructions are encoded into the byte using a bitmask
where low 4 bits encode the graphics mode or feature and the high 4 bits
encode the flags that affect that instruction:

  +-----+-----+---------+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  |  7  |  6  |  5      |    4    |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
  +-----+-----+---------+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | DLI | LMS | VSCROLL | HSCROLL |  Mode                 |
  +-----+-----+---------+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+

The 4 flags are:

 * DLI (``$80``): enable a display list interrupt when processing this instruction
 * LMS (``$40``): trigger a Load Memory Scan, changing where ANTIC looks for screen data, and requires an additional 2 byte address immediately following this instruction byte.
 * VSCROLL (``$20``): enable vertical scrolling for this mode line
 * HSCROLL (``$10``): enable horizontal scrolling for this mode line

The 14 available graphics modes are encoded into low 4 bits using values as
shown in this table:

.. csv-table::

    Mode, Decimal, BASIC Mode,  Description, Scan Lines, Type, Colors
    2, 02,    0,     40 x 24,   8, text, 2
    3, 03,    n/a,   40 x 19,  10, text, 2
    4, 04,    n/a,   40 x 24,   8, text, 5
    5, 05,    n/a,   40 x 12,  16, text, 5
    6, 06,    1,     20 x 24,   8, text, 5
    7, 07,    2,     20 x 12,  16, text, 5
    8, 08,    3,     40 x 24,   8, bitmap, 4
    9, 09,    4,     80 x 48,   4, bitmap, 2
    A, 10,    5,     80 x 48,   4, bitmap, 4
    B, 11,    6,    160 x 96,   2, bitmap, 2
    C, 12,    n/a,  160 x 192,  1, bitmap, 2
    D, 13,    7,    160 x 96,   2, bitmap, 4
    E, 14,    n/a,  160 x 192,  1, bitmap, 4
    F, 15,    8,    320 x 192,  1, bitmap, 2

.. note:: The important modes for scrolling are the text modes, and for games in particular ANTIC modes 4 and 5. Any modes can be scrolled horizontally, and modes taller than 1 scan line can also be scrolled vertically, but the combination of memory usage and large height of the text modes make them ideal candidates for scrolling games.

Blank lines are encoded as a mode value of zero, the bits 6, 5, and 4 taking
the meaning of the number of blank lines rather than LMS, VSCROLL, and
HSCROLL. Note that the DLI bit is still available on blank lines, as bit 7 is
not co-opted by the blank line instruction.

.. csv-table:: Blank Line Instructions

    Hex, Decimal, Blank Lines
    0, 0, 1
    10, 16, 2
    20, 32, 3
    30, 48, 4
    40, 64, 5
    50, 80, 6
    60, 96, 7
    70, 112, 8

Jumps provide the capability to split a display list into multiple parts in
different memory locations. They are encoded using a mode value of one, and
require an additional 2 byte address where ANTIC will look for the next display
list instruction. If bit 6 is also set, it becomes the Jump and wait for Vertical
Blank (JVB) instruction, which is how ANTIC knows that the display list is
finished. The DLI bit may also be set on a jump instruction, but if set on the
JVB instruction it triggers a DLI on every scan line from there until the
vertical blank starts on the 249th scan line.

.. note::

   Apart from the ``$41`` JVB instruction, splitting display lists using other
   jumps like the ``$01`` instruction is not common. It has a side-effect of
   producing a single blank line in the display list.

The typical method to change the currently active display list is to change the
address stored at ``SDLSTL`` (in low byte/high byte format in addresses
``$230`` and ``$231``). At the next vertical blank, the hardware display list
at ``DLISTL`` (``$d402`` and ``$d403``) will be updated with the values stored
here and the screen drawing will commence using the new display list.

A Crash Course on Course Scrolling
---------------------------------------

Course scrolling, that is: scrolling with blocky jumps, can be accomplished
without any use of the hardware scrolling registers. In fact, course scrolling
falls out as a side-effect of the ``LMS`` bit on display list commands. Being
able to reposition the memory pointer for any display list instruction means
that you can tell ANTIC where to look in memory when it draws a scan line.
Simply by moving the address pointer to a different location, you can change
the display.

First we will look at vertical course scrolling which is the simpler case than
horizontal course scrolling. After examining horizontal course scrolling, we
will combine the two which will give us unrestricted 2D scrolling.



Vertical Course Scrolling
------------------------------------------

Course scrolling vertically is moving the playfield data such that the user
sees a new line of information on the top of the screen while the line that was
previously on the on the bottom of the screen moves off, and all other visible
lines move down one line. (Or vice-versa: new data appears on the bottom while
a line is removed from the top.) This direction is simpler than horizontal
because only a single ``LMS`` instruction needs to be updated, so that is where
we will start.

A Starting Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a display list without any scrolling, and just a single ``LMS``
instruction on the first mode 4 line to tell ANTIC where to look in memory for
that first line. Subsequent mode 4 lines follow immediately after in memory:
ANTIC will use memory contiguously until told otherwise by another ``LMS``
instruction.

   </ul>

All this test program does is create a display list and show a simple test
pattern. There is nothing special about this display list, no scrolling bits
set on any display list instructions; only the ``LMS`` instruction to set the
initial memory location for the 22 lines of ANTIC Mode 4, and the two lines of
ANTIC mode 2 at the bottom. (These two lines will be used as a comparison when
we add scrolling to this display list in the next section.)

.. code-block::

   ; Simple display list to be used as course scrolling comparison
   dlist_course_mode4
           .byte $70,$70,$70       ; 24 blank lines
           .byte $44,$00,$80       ; Mode 4 + LMS + address
           .byte 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4   ; 21 more Mode 4 lines
           .byte 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4
           .byte 4,4,4,4,4
           .byte $42,<static_text, >static_text ; 2 Mode 2 lines + LMS + address
           .byte $2
           .byte $41,<dlist_course_mode4,>dlist_course_mode4 ; JVB ends display list



Horizontal Course Scrolling
------------------------------------------

Horizontal course scrolling is only slightly more complicated than vertical
course scrolling because multiple ``LMS`` addresses need to be updated.
