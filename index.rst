Atari 8-bit Fine Scrolling: An (In)Complete(ish) Tutorial
======================================================================

**Revision 1, updated 12 Dec 2019**

This is a tutorial on fine scrolling for the Atari 8-bit series of computers.
In a nutshell, the ANTIC coprocessor provides 2D hardware scrolling at very
little computational expense.

Scrolling means the display screen is a window or *viewport* on a larger map.
At any moment in time, the user is looking at only a small portion of the
overall area, and this viewport can be moved around. The Atari hardware
provides for both course scrolling (that is, moving the viewport at byte or
character boundaries) and fine scrolling (moving with higher resolution: scan
lines vertically and color clocks horizontally). Fine scrolling on the Atari is
built upon course scrolling, so we will first examine the latter before make
the scrolling smooth by tackling the former.

No prior knowledge of scrolling is necessary before reading this tutorial.
However, this is advanced programming tutorial in the sense that the examples
are written in assembly language, so the assumption will be that you are
comfortable with that. All the examples here are assembled using the
MAC/65-compatible assembler `ATasm
<https://atari.miribilist.com/atasm/index.html>`_ (and more specifically to
this tutorial, the version built-in to `Omnivore
<https://github.com/robmcmullen/omnivore>`_).

A Refresher on Display Lists
--------------------------------------------

Display lists are an important topic for scrolling, because certain flags on
display list commands tell ANTIC which lines get scrolled and which are left
alone. For a summary, check out my :ref:`tutorial on DLIs <dli_tutorial>` which
has a large section on display list instructions. A small amount of relevant
detail is repeated here.

An ANTIC display list instruction consists of 1 byte with an optional 2 byte
address. There are 3 types of instructions: blank lines, graphics modes, and
jump instructions. Instructions are encoded into the byte using a bitmask
where low 4 bits encode the graphics mode or feature and the high 4 bits
encode the flags that affect that instruction:

  +-----+-----+---------+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  |  7  |  6  |  5      |    4    |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
  +-----+-----+---------+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | DLI | LMS | VSCROLL | HSCROLL |  Mode                 |
  +-----+-----+---------+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+

The 4 flags are:

 * DLI (``$80``): enable a display list interrupt when processing this instruction
 * LMS (``$40``): trigger a Load Memory Scan, changing where ANTIC looks for screen data, and requires an additional 2 byte address immediately following this instruction byte.
 * VSCROLL (``$20``): enable vertical scrolling for this mode line
 * HSCROLL (``$10``): enable horizontal scrolling for this mode line

There are 14 available graphics modes, which are encoded into low 4 bits. This
tutorial is only going to focus on three of the text modes. Any mode can be
scrolled horizontally, and modes taller than 1 scan line can also be scrolled
vertically, but the combination of low memory usage and large height of the
text modes make them ideal candidates for scrolling games.

Course Scrolling
---------------------------------------

Course scrolling, that is: scrolling at character or byte boundaries (in what
appears on screen as blocky jumps), can be accomplished without any use of the
hardware scrolling registers. In fact, course scrolling falls out as a side-
effect of the ``LMS`` bit on display list commands. Being able to reposition
the memory pointer for any display list instruction means that you can tell
ANTIC where to look in memory when it draws a scan line. Simply by moving the
address pointer to a different location, you can change the display.

First we will look at vertical course scrolling which is the simpler case than
horizontal course scrolling. After examining horizontal course scrolling, we
will combine the two which will give us unrestricted 2D scrolling.


Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It helps to set up what we mean by the directions, because depending on your
perspective, **scrolling up** and **scrolling down** (and similarly **left**
and **right**) could mean exactly opposite things. Are the directions referring
to which way the data is moving on the screen? Or which way the viewport is
moving over the larger screen memory layout?

The convention is to refer to the direction as the way the viewport is moving.
So, **scrolling up** means the viewport is moving up over the screen memory
layout, but what that means in terms of what's displayed is that new data is
appearing at the top of the screen, pushing everything else down the screen and
old data is vanishing off the bottom of the screen.

Because there are so many types of lines, the word line becomes ambiguous without clarification. There are:

 * scan lines on screen
 * number of scan lines in a character cell
 * lines of characters in the viewport
 * lines of characters in the screen memory layout



Vertical Course Scrolling
------------------------------------------

Course scrolling vertically is moving the playfield data such that the user
sees a new line of information on the top of the screen while the line that was
previously on the on the bottom of the screen moves off, and all other visible
lines move down one line. (Or vice-versa: new data appears on the bottom while
a line is removed from the top.) This direction is simpler than horizontal
because only a single ``LMS`` instruction needs to be updated, so that is where
we will start.

.. _course_no_scroll_dlist:

A Starting Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a display list without any scrolling, and just a single instruction
with ``LMS`` set in the main region of mode 4 lines. That ``LMS`` tells ANTIC
where to look in memory for that first line and all subsequent lines until another ``LMS`` instruction is encountered.

   </ul>

All this test program does is create a display list and show a simple test
pattern. There is nothing special about this display list, no scrolling bits
set on any display list instructions; only the ``LMS`` instruction to set the
initial memory location for the 22 lines of ANTIC Mode 4 that will become the
scrolling region in further examples, and another ``LMS`` for the two lines of
ANTIC mode 2 at the bottom for non-scrolling status lines.

.. code-block::

   ; Simple display list to be used as course scrolling comparison
   dlist_course_mode4
           .byte $70,$70,$70       ; 24 blank lines
           .byte $44,$00,$80       ; Mode 4 + LMS + address
           .byte 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4   ; 21 more Mode 4 lines
           .byte 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4
           .byte 4,4,4,4,4
           .byte $42,<static_text, >static_text ; 2 Mode 2 lines + LMS + address
           .byte $2
           .byte $41,<dlist_course_mode4,>dlist_course_mode4 ; JVB ends display list


Memory Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To move a viewport window up or down over a larger map doesn't require any
difference in memory layout for the screen data, just more of it.

.. figure:: memory_layout_vertical.png

   :width: 50%

.. _course_scroll_down:

Course Scrolling Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scrolling down means new data is appearing at the bottom of the screen, pushing
data currently on the screen upwards and finally disappearing off the top of
the screen:

.. figure:: course_scroll_down.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li><b>Source Code:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/src/course_scroll_down.s">course_scroll_down.s</a></li>
   <li><b>Executable:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/xex/course_scroll_down.xex">course_scroll_down.xex</a></li>
   </ul>

This is accomplished by updating the start address that ANTIC sees for the
first line. 

.. code-block::

   ; move viewport one line down by pointing display list start address
   ; to the address 40 bytes further in memory
   course_scroll_down
           clc
           lda dlist_course_address
           adc #40
           sta dlist_course_address
           lda dlist_course_address+1
           adc #0
           sta dlist_course_address+1
           rts

Adding 40 bytes to that address will move the starting point one
line higher in memory, moving what was the 2nd line being displayed to the
first line and a line previously off-screen to the 22nd line. This gives the
appearance of the playfield window moving down across the map.

The code needs a timing loop so the scrolling doesn't happen too fast:

.. code-block::

   loop
           ldx #15         ; number of VBLANKs to wait
   ?start  lda RTCLOK+2    ; check fastest moving RTCLOCK byte
   ?wait   cmp RTCLOK+2    ; VBLANK will update this
           beq ?wait       ; delay until VBLANK changes it
           dex             ; delay for a number of VBLANKs
           bpl ?start
   
           ; enough time has passed, scroll one line
           jsr course_scroll_down
   
           jmp loop

This delay loop simply waits for a number of vertical blank intervals to pass,
then updates the screen memory pointer.



Course Scrolling Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scrolling up means new data is appearing at the top of the screen, pushing data
currently on the screen downwards and finally disappearing off the bottom of
the screen:

.. figure:: course_scroll_up.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li><b>Source Code:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/src/course_scroll_up.s">course_scroll_up.s</a></li>
   <li><b>Executable:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/xex/course_scroll_up.xex">course_scroll_up.xex</a></li>
   </ul>

This is accomplished using exactly the same method of changing the start
address that ANTIC uses for the screen memory:

.. code-block::

   ; move viewport one line down by pointing display list start address
   ; to the address 40 bytes further in memory
   course_scroll_down
           clc
           lda dlist_course_address
           adc #40
           sta dlist_course_address
           lda dlist_course_address+1
           adc #0
           sta dlist_course_address+1
           rts

But instead of adding 40 bytes, we subtract 40 bytes from the address to move
the starting point one line prior in memory, moving what was the 1st line being
displayed to the 2nd line and a line previously off-screen to the 1st line.
This gives the appearance of the playfield window moving up across the map.




Horizontal Course Scrolling
------------------------------------------

Horizontal course scrolling is only slightly more complicated than vertical
course scrolling because multiple ``LMS`` addresses need to be updated.



Memory Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scrolling left and right does present a different problem, because if only the
first ``LMS`` address is updated, a subsequent line will use memory immediately
following the previous line, resulting in a snake-like movement that doesn't
resemble scrolling.

To remedy this, the memory should be thought of as individual horizontal
strips, which for ANTIC to process correctly requires ``LMS`` addresses on
every display list line in the scrolling region.

.. figure:: memory_layout_horizontal.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

For this tutorial, the horizontal memory layout is going to use an entire page
of memory (256 bytes, so 256 characters) per line of screen memory. At the cost
of some RAM, this will simplify our ``LMS`` modifications in that only the low
byte will need to be modified in the case of pure horizontal scrolling, and
only the high byte needs to change in the case of pure vertical scrolling.

This is a tradeoff that is good for speed and reduced code complexity, but if
your memory constraints outweigh your speed requirements, this may not be a
tradeoff you are willing to make. The byte width of your screen memory layout
is entirely arbitrary; the ``LMS`` calculations will just be more complicated
(and therefore slower) with widths where you must do arithmetic to calculate
the addresses.



Course Scrolling Left
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scrolling left means new data is appearing on the left of the screen, pushing
data currently on the screen to the right and finally disappearing off the
right side of the screen. Every 16 bytes, the memory layout has been stamped
with the hex addresses of the screen memory so you can tell where the viewport
has scrolled to.

.. figure:: course_scroll_left.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li><b>Source Code:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/src/course_scroll_left.s">course_scroll_left.s</a></li>
   <li><b>Executable:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/xex/course_scroll_left.xex">course_scroll_left.xex</a></li>
   </ul>

Because each ``LMS`` address in the scrolling region and the one-line buffer
zone must be updated, a loop is used here. Moving to the left means moving
lower in memory, in this case: one byte at a time:

.. code-block::

   ; move viewport one byte to the left by pointing each display list start
   ; address to one byte lower in memory
   course_scroll_left
           ldy #22         ; 22 lines to modify
           ldx #4          ; 4th byte after start of display list is low byte of address
   ?loop   dec dlist_lms_mode4,x
           inx             ; skip to next low byte which is 3 bytes away
           inx
           inx
           dey
           bne ?loop
           rts

There's no bounds checking in this example, so if you let it run long enough it
will display  low byte address moves from ``$00`` to
``$ff``. "Defender"-style wrapping, to make it appear like there is no start or
end, takes some special preparations and will be discussed below.

Here's the display list:

.. code-block::

   ; one page per line, used for course scrolling. Start visible region
   ; in middle of each page so it can scroll either right or left immediately
   ; without having to check for a border
   dlist_lms_mode4
           .byte $70,$70,$70
           .byte $44,$70,$80       ; first line of scrolling region
           .byte $44,$70,$81
           .byte $44,$70,$82
           .byte $44,$70,$83
           .byte $44,$70,$84
           .byte $44,$70,$85
           .byte $44,$70,$86
           .byte $44,$70,$87
           .byte $44,$70,$88
           .byte $44,$70,$89
           .byte $44,$70,$8a
           .byte $44,$70,$8b
           .byte $44,$70,$8c
           .byte $44,$70,$8d
           .byte $44,$70,$8e
           .byte $44,$70,$8f
           .byte $44,$70,$90
           .byte $44,$70,$91
           .byte $44,$70,$92
           .byte $44,$70,$93
           .byte $44,$70,$94
           .byte $44,$70,$95       ; last line with scroll bit set
           .byte $42,<hscroll_static_text, >hscroll_static_text ; 2 Mode 2 lines + LMS + address
           .byte $2
           .byte $41,<dlist_lms_mode4,>dlist_lms_mode4 ; JVB ends display list

Course Scrolling Right
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scrolling right means new data is appearing on the right of the screen, pushing
data currently on the screen to the left and finally disappearing off the
left side of the screen. 

.. figure:: course_scroll_right.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li><b>Source Code:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/src/course_scroll_right.s">course_scroll_right.s</a></li>
   <li><b>Executable:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/xex/course_scroll_right.xex">course_scroll_right.xex</a></li>
   </ul>

The code for this is exactly analogous to scrolling left, except we are
incrementing the ``LMS`` pointer, moving one byte higher in memory to push the
viewport to the right.

.. code-block::

   ; move viewport one byte to the right by pointing each display list start
   ; address to one byte higher in memory
   course_scroll_right
           ldy #22         ; 22 lines to modify
           ldx #4          ; 4th byte after start of display list is low byte of address
   ?loop   inc dlist_lms_mode4,x
           inx             ; skip to next low byte which is 3 bytes away
           inx
           inx
           dey
           bne ?loop
           rts

The display list is exactly the same as in the scrolling left example.




Combined Course Scrolling
--------------------------------------------------

Simultaneous horizontal and vertical course scrolling is possible with very
little additional effort over horizontal course scrolling alone.

Adding vertical scrolling to a display list that uses ``LMS`` addresses for
every line means that, unlike the simple vertical scrolling that used a single
``LMS`` address for the whole screen, *every* display list line in the
scrolling region will have to be modified to point to a new vertical location
in the memory layout.

Memory Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Combining horizontal and vertical scrolling requires combining the memory
layout ideas: wide horizontal lines coupled with lines above and below the
viewport.

.. figure:: memory_layout_2d.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

As in the horizontal scrolling examples above, the combined scrolling examples
will also use the page-per-line memory layout: 256 bytes per line.

Horizontal course scrolling requires an ``LMS`` address for every display list
line in the scrolling region, and using this memory layout means that the low
byte of that address is modified for every scroll. The high byte is unmodified.

Vertical course scrolling using this display list and memory layout is
convenient because the vertical position of the viewport is solely dependent on
the high byte of the memory address; the low byte is unchanged.

This memory layout simplifies combined scrolling because it decouples the
vertical position and horizontal position! Combined scrolling is then reduced
to changing the high byte of each ``LMS`` address to reflect the vertical
location of the viewport, and changing the low byte to set the horizontal
location.


Course Scrolling Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example scrolls the viewport simultaneously in the vertical and horizontal
directions using the techniques described above.

.. figure:: course_scroll_2d.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li><b>Source Code:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/src/course_scroll_2d.s">course_scroll_2d.s</a></li>
   <li><b>Executable:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/xex/course_scroll_2d.xex">course_scroll_2d.xex</a></li>
   </ul>

The display list is unchanged from the horizontal course scrolling examples.

There are several differences in code from the horizontal scrolling version.
First some variables are added to track the direction at which the viewport is
moving (and they are initialized):

.. code-block::

   horz_dir = $80  ; 1 = right, $ff = left
   vert_dir = $81  ; 1 = down, $ff = up

           lda #$ff
           sta horz_dir
           lda #1
           sta vert_dir

We will need to track where the viewport is on screen, and instead of creating
extra variables for it, we can realize that the display list itself will tell
us where the viewport is. Choosing the reference point to be the upper left
corder of the viewport window means that the very first ``LMS`` instruction in
the display list is exactly our reference point. The low byte of the ``LMS``
address is the horizontal position and the high byte is the vertical.

.. code-block::

    ; representative values for vertical and horizontal scrolling: the pointers
    ; to the display list LMS addresses themselves
    horz_ref = dlist_lms_mode4 + 4
    vert_ref = dlist_lms_mode4 + 5

The code that moves the viewport horizontally checks the horizontal direction
before determining how to changing the low bytes of the ``LMS`` addresses:

.. code-block::

   ; move viewport one byte to the left/right by pointing each display list
   ; address to one lower/byte higher in memory (i.e. changing low byte)
   course_scroll_horz
           ldy #22         ; 22 lines to modify
           ldx #0
           lda horz_dir
           bmi ?left
   ?right  inc horz_ref,x  ; low bytes of display list referenced at this addr
           inx             ; skip to next low byte which is 3 bytes away
           inx
           inx
           dey
           bne ?right
           rts
   
   ?left   dec horz_ref,x  ; low bytes of display list referenced at this addr
           inx             ; skip to next low byte which is 3 bytes away
           inx
           inx
           dey
           bne ?left
           rts

Vertical scrolling changes the high bytes of the ``LMS`` addresses lines. The
code is very similar to the above:

.. code-block::

   ; move viewport one line up/down by pointing each display list address
   ; one *page* lower/byte higher in memory (i.e. changing high byte)
   course_scroll_vert
           ldy #22         ; 22 lines to modify
           ldx #0
           lda vert_dir
           bmi ?up
   ?down   inc vert_ref,x  ; high bytes of display list referenced at this addr
           inx             ; skip to next high byte which is 3 bytes away
           inx
           inx
           dey
           bne ?down
           rts
   
   ?up     dec vert_ref,x  ; high bytes of display list referenced at this addr
           inx             ; skip to next high byte which is 3 bytes away
           inx
           inx
           dey
           bne ?up
           rts

Some boundary checking is added referencing some constants describing the
limits of the memory layout, and the viewport bounces off the sides as if it
were a pong game.

.. code-block::

   horz_min = 0    ; horizontal lower bound
   horz_max = 255-44 ; horizontal upper bound is page width, less some extra to prevent unintentional wraparound
   vert_min = $80  ; page $80 is first line in memory region
   vert_max = $80+52-22 ; 52 lines high and 22 visible at a time

           ; check if horizontal direction needs updating
           lda horz_ref    ; reference horizontal position
           cmp #horz_max   ; too far to the right?
           bcc ?ck_left
           lda #$ff        ; yep, start scrolling left
           sta horz_dir
           bne ?ck_down

Vertical Fine Scrolling
-----------------------------------------------

Vertical fine scrolling is controlled by ANTIC's ``VSCROL`` hardware register.
The register can be any number from 0 - 15 representing the number of scan
lines to scroll. ANTIC accomplishes scrolling not by moving the display list up
and down by a number of scan lines, but by using the ``VSCROL`` value to *skip*
that number of scan lines in the first line of the display list, essentially
shortening the number of displayed lines.

This will become more clear with an example. First, let's see what happens just
by turning on the vertical scrolling bit on a display list.

First Display List With Scrolling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's the same program used in the :ref:`course vertical scrolling
<course_no_scroll_dlist>` section, except now the vertical scrolling bit has
been set on the display list instructions for the scrolling region of lines A
through V. Notice the first line of the mode 2 status lines at he bottom seems
to be missing! Actually, it is still there, or more correctly: one scan line of
it is still there.

   </ul>

Note that the ``VSCROL`` hardware register is set to zero. Here's the display list:

.. code-block::

   ; Simple display list to be used as course scrolling comparison
   dlist_course_mode4
           .byte $70,$70,$70       ; 24 blank lines
           .byte $44,$00,$80       ; Mode 4 + LMS + address
           .byte $64,$00,$80       ; Mode 4 + VSCROLL + LMS + address
           .byte $24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24   ; 21 more Mode 4 + VSCROLL lines
           .byte $24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24
           .byte $24,$24,$24,$24,$24
           .byte $42,<static_text, >static_text ; 2 Mode 2 lines + LMS + address
           .byte $2
           .byte $41,<dlist_course_mode4,>dlist_course_mode4 ; JVB ends display list

So what is the mystery of the (mostly) missing mode 2 line at the bottom? ANTIC
uses the first scan line that doesn't have the vertical scrolling bit set as a
sort-of *buffer zone* to the scrolling region.

Here's the same example, except the ``VSCROL`` register is set to 4:

.. figure:: fine_vscroll_4.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

where it shows that 4 scan lines of line A have been scrolled off the screen
**and** the first ANTIC mode 2 line shows 4 of its 8 scan lines.

ANTIC's Vertical Scrolling Buffer Zone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``VSCROL`` hardware register controls how many scan lines are shifted for
fine scrolling. The value tells ANTIC on which scan line to start rendering for
the first display list instruction it encounters with the vertical scrolling
bit set. Subsequent lines in the display list that have the vertical scrolling
bit set are fully rendered, but because that initial scan line was rendered
with fewer scan lines, the display has appeared to move up.

What confused the author until reading section 4.7 in the `Altirra Hardware Reference Manual <http://www.virtualdub.org/downloads/Altirra%20Hardware%20Reference%20Manual.pdf>`_
is that ``VSCROL`` value also controls where ANTIC *stops* rendering on that
*buffer zone* display list instruction: it renders scan lines up to and
including that value.

In the first example, ``VSCROL = 0``. ANTIC mode 4 lines are 8 scan lines tall,
and for scrolling purposes the height of a mode line is enumerated from 0, so
an 8 scan line tall text mode has scan lines numbered 0 through 7. For the
example, the rendering of line A starts at scan line zero of the text mode. The
buffer zone mode 2 line that is only rendered with a single scan line: it
stopped rendering after rendering scan line zero of that mode 2 line.

The second example uses ``VSCROL`` set to 4, here shown in detail:


.. figure:: detail_vscrol_4.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

The first display list line with the vertical scrolling bit set, Line A, is
rendered starting from scan line 4 (again, as enumerated from zero: scan lines
0, 1, 2, and 3 are skipped and 4, 5, 6, and 7 are rendered). All subsequent
lines with their vertical scroll bit set have all 8 scan lines rendered. The
buffer zone, that is: the first display list line without the scroll bit set,
is rendered *through* scan line 4 as enumerated from zero, so scan lines 0, 1,
2, 3, and 4. Scan lines 5 through 7 are not rendered.


Fixing the Last Scrolled Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having the scrolled region extend into the status lines at the bottom of the
previous example is obviously not what's intended. This example fixes that
problem:

.. figure:: fine_vscroll_better_dlist.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li><b>Source Code:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/src/fine_vscroll_better_dlist.s">fine_vscroll_better_dlist.s</a></li>
   <li><b>Executable:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/xex/fine_vscroll_better_dlist.xex">fine_vscroll_better_dlist.xex</a></li>
   </ul>

The solution is to clear the vertical scrolling bit on the final mode 4 line in
the scrolling region. Here's the new display list with only a single byte
changed: the final ``$24`` in the previous example is changed to a normal mode
4 line:

.. code-block::

   ; Simple display list to be used as course scrolling comparison
   dlist_course_mode4
           .byte $70,$70,$70       ; 24 blank lines
           .byte $44,$00,$80       ; Mode 4 + LMS + address
           .byte $64,$00,$80       ; Mode 4 + VSCROLL + LMS + address
           .byte $24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24   ; 20 more Mode 4 + VSCROLL lines
           .byte $24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24,$24
           .byte $24,$24,$24,$24
           .byte 4                 ; and the final Mode 4 without VSCROLL
           .byte $42,<static_text, >static_text ; 2 Mode 2 lines + LMS + address
           .byte $2
           .byte $41,<dlist_course_mode4,>dlist_course_mode4 ; JVB ends display list

This leaves the status lines with two complete mode 2 lines, and the scrolling
playfield as 21 mode 4 lines, and a one line *buffer zone*, this time of mode
4. In this case, ``VSCROL = 4``, so the first scrolled line is rendered
starting at its scan line 4 and the buffer zone line is rendered through its
scan line 4, we are missing 7 scan lines from the same display list without any
vertical scrolling bits.

.. note:: The number of scan lines ANTIC will generate is reduced by vertical scrolling. The total number of scan lines can be counted by setting ``VSCROL = 0``, meaning the buffer zone line will be reduced to a single scan line. Changes to ``VSCROL`` don't change the total number of lines generated, for instance: setting ``VSCROL = 2`` reduces the first scrolled line to 6 scan lines but increases the buffer zone to 3 scan lines, resulting in the same net number of scan lines in the scrolling + buffer zone regions.


Fine Scrolling Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can now add the ``VSCROL`` hardware register to the course scrolling demo to
produce fine scrolling:

.. figure:: fine_scroll_down.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li><b>Source Code:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/src/fine_scroll_down.s">fine_scroll_down.s</a></li>
   <li><b>Executable:</b> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playermissile/scrolling_tutorial/master/xex/fine_scroll_down.xex">fine_scroll_down.xex</a></li>
   </ul>

The code for this example is largely the same as the :ref:`course scroll down
<course_scroll_down>` demo, which a few minor additions. We need one
additional variable to keep our own copy of the hardware scrolling register,
since ``VSCROL`` is a write-only register:

.. code-block::

   vert_scroll = $90       ; variable used to store VSCROL value
   vert_scroll_max = 8     ; ANTIC mode 4 has 8 scan lines

The ``init`` code from the demo also needs to initialize the variable:

.. code-block::

           lda #0          ; initialize vertical scrolling value
           sta vert_scroll

and the main loop calls the fine scrolling routine instead of the course
scrolling routine.

.. code-block::

   loop    ldx #delay      ; number of VBLANKs to wait
   ?start  lda RTCLOK+2    ; check fastest moving RTCLOCK byte
   ?wait   cmp RTCLOK+2    ; VBLANK will update this
           beq ?wait       ; delay until VBLANK changes it
           dex             ; delay for a number of VBLANKs
           bpl ?start
   
           ; enough time has passed, scroll one scan line
           jsr fine_scroll_down
   
           jmp loop

The ``fine_scroll_down`` routine takes care of updating the fine scrolling
variable and setting the hardware ``VSCROL`` register. If it has scrolled 8
scan lines, it calls the ``course_scroll_down`` routine, which is unchanged
from the course scrolling demo.

.. code-block::

   ; scroll one scan line down and check if at HSCROL limit
   fine_scroll_down
           inc vert_scroll
           lda vert_scroll
           cmp #vert_scroll_max ; check to see if we need to do a course scroll
           bcc ?done       ; nope, still in the middle of the character
           jsr course_scroll_down ; yep, do a course scroll...
           lda #0          ;  ...followed by reseting the vscroll register
           sta vert_scroll
   ?done   sta VSCROL      ; store vertical scroll value in hardware register
           rts



Fine Scrolling Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code for fine scrolling the viewport up has very few changes from the above.

Horizontal Fine Scrolling
------------------------------------------------------



Interlude: Vertical Blank Interrupts
------------------------------------------------

The technique we have been using where we waiting until the the vertical blank
has *just* passed as the trigger to begin our modifications to ``LMS``
addresses and the scrolling registers is not going to be sufficient when we
move to horizontal scrolling.

For vertical scrolling by itself, it *is* largely sufficient because ANTIC will
not go back and re-read the LMS address of a previously processed display list
command. Changing the ``LMS`` while ANTIC is in the middle screen would only
have the effect of delaying the update by a frame.  However, changing the
hardware ``VSCROL`` register in the middle of a frame will have immediate
effect, and for more complicated scrolling examples in subsequent sections,
changes will happen in the vertical blank.
